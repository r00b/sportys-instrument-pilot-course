# Advanced IFR

* Garmin GFC 500
  * Autopilot must be disconnected at or above 200 AGL (lowest minimums for Cat I ILS)
  * Should not be re-engaged until at least 800 AGL

## Night IFR
* 400 feet of altitude per mile from the runway is a good place to start

## Engine performance

### Variable Pitch Propeller
* Low gear is when propeller pitch is low, control is full forward, and engine RPM is high
* High gear is when propeller takes biggest bite; propeller pitch is high, controll is full back, and engine RPM is low
* Manifold pressure gauge indirectly indicates power output of engine
  * Pressure of fuel-air mixture immediately before entering cylinder
* Can set propeller for low RPM with max throttle
  * Causes high cylinder pressure, leading to overheating, detonation, and preignition
* Cylinder head temperature gauge gives much earlier warning of increasing temperature than oil temperature gauge
* Rule of thumb: keep CHTs under 400F

### High Altitude
* RVSM applies from FL290 to FL410
* Requires:
  * Pilot training and aircraft approval
  * Two independent altimeter systems
  * Altitude control system (autopilot)
  * Altitude deviation alert
* DME required above FL240 unless you have a suitable GPS replacement
* Q-Routes
  * High-altitude RNAV routes from FL180-FL450
