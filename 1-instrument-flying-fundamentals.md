# Instrument Flying Fundamentals

## Instruments

### Pitch Instruments
* Airspede
* Attitude
* Altimeter
* VSI

### Bank Instruments
* Attitude
* Heading
* Turn
* Ball

### Power Instruments
* Airspeed
* Tachometer
* Manifold Pressure

## Pitch changes
* 100 feet or less: half-bar width pitch change
* 100 feet or more: full-bar width pitch change
* Rate of return (VSI) should not exceed double the amount of correction
* Level off from climb when reching 10% of the rate of climb (50 ft for 500 fpm)
* Level off (normal speed) from descent at 10% of descent rate
* Level off (high speed) from descent at 20-30% of descent rate
