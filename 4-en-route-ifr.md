# En Route IFR

## IFR Low Altitude En Route Chart
* Victor Airways, RNAV T-routes belo FL18
  * RNAV Terminal transition routes
* En Route chart issued every 56 days
* Even numbered Victor Airways run east-west, odd numbered north-south
* Black reporting points are VOR-based, brown are NDB-based
* Blue stars are RNAV reporting points
* Solid are compulsory, open are non compulsory
* Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA)
  * Meet obstacle clearance requirements, assures a satisfactory navigation signal, and the identification of fixes on the airway
* Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOAC)
  * Prefixed with `*`
  * Obstacle clearance and VOR reception within 22 NM of the station
  * At least 1000 feet above highest obstruction (2000 over mountainous terrain) on 4 NM on either side of the airway centerline
* Off-Route Obstruction-Clearance Altitude (OROCA)
  * Does not guarnatee NAV signal reception, radar coverage, or communications with ATC
* Minimum Reception Altitude (flag with R)
  * Altitude to receieve NAV signals
* MEA gap
  * Gap in navigation signal coverage at the MEA
* Maximum Authorized Altitude (MAA)
  * Highest altitude permitted along an airway
* Minimum Crossing Altitude
  * Minimum altitude required before crossing a fix
* VOR changeover should occur midpoint on an airway
  * Unless airway bends
* Blue and green airports have an instrument approach available
* Brown airports do not have approach, but have runways > 3000 feet
* Low altitude RNAV routes are depicted in blue with a T
* Crossbars depict Victor airway altitude changes

## Weather
* Current Icing Product (CIP) and Forecast Icing Product (FIP)
* Beware of occluded fronts; typically include all weather hazards before, during, and after an occluded front
* If wind is southerly and stronger than forecast on a westbound trip, weather ahead will likely be worse than forecast#

## Tips
* `T` in upside-down triangle means non-standard takeoff minimums or special departure procedures
* `A` in ups-deidown triangle means airport cannot be used as an alternate or has non-standard alternate minimums
* Takeoff minimums require only to aircraft operated for-hire; not required for Part 91 (but a good idea)
  * However, all aircraft must comply with the prescribed departure procedures
* To calculate required rate of climb, divide your projected groundspeed by 60 to find your miles per minute and multiply that by the climb required

## Lights
* Look up code from symbol from approach chart in Terminal Procedures Supplement
* Inverse coloring signifies pilot-controlled lighting

## Notes
* GPS can be used as a substition for DME when GPS is IFR approved, current, and fix names are in the GPS database
* Determine if airport is within radar coverage with AFD/Chart Supplement

## Approach Design
* Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS)
  * Highest line drawn at highest obstacle in area
  * No obstacle may penerate OCS
* Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC)
  * Minimum vertical separation between aircraft and the OCS
  * Level for initial approach segments
  * Sloping for final glideslope segment
  * Guarnateed 1000' obstacle clearance
* Initial segment ROC
  * Primary area
    * 1000' clearance
  * Seconday Area
    * 500' clearance tapering to 0' at the edges
* Intermediate segment ROC
  * Primary area - 500'
  * Seconday area - tapering to 0' at the edges
* Non-precision approach (Localizer, VOR, LNAV, LP)
  * Primary area typically 250'
  * Secondary area tapers to 0'
* Precision approach (ILS or LPV)
  * Primary area typically 200'
  * Secondary area tapers to 0'
* Minimum 300' obstacle clearance in the circling areas
  * Circling may be NA in certain sectors
* Obstacle may prevent implementation of a precision approach
* Missed approach obstacle protection guaranteed only when starting the procedure at the MAP and no turns are started before that point

## Alternates
* Require to have enough to fly to first airport of intended landing, and thereafter for 45 minutes at normal cruising speed
* Conditions that do not require filing an alternate
  1. **1** hour before to 1 hour after the ETA
  2. **2**,000 foot ceiling or greater
  3. **3** statute miles visibility minimum
  * Airport must have instrument approach procedure
* Black tiangle with letter A: nonstandard alternate minimums
  * Refer to Terminal Procedures Supplement to review minimum weather forecast required to use the airport as an alternate
* **Basic requirements for alternate minimums**
  * Airport with precision approach
    * 600 feet ceiling
    * 2 SM visibility
  * Airport with non-precision approach
    * 800 feet ceiling
    * 2 SM visibility
  * Airport without instrument approach
    * Weather forecast permits an approach and landing from the MEA (Minimum Enroute Altitude) in VFR conditions
    * Use the GFA if no TAFs available for the airport
* Consider possibility of holding against available fuel
* It is not required by the FARs to go to the filed alternate if unable to land at the intended destination
  * i.e. you are not required to use the *filed* alternate
* Alternate minimums are for planning purposes only; if you actually go to the alternate, weather must only be as good as required by the instrument approach used to land at the alternate
