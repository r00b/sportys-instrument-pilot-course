# FARs and Your Instrument Test

* Cold front usually 5000 AGL 3 hours after passage
* Shear usually greater in warm front, usually from just before passage to 6 hours after passage
* Wind shear can be expected in low level temperature inversion when wind speed between 2000 and 4000 feet is 25+ knots
* Microburst downdraft usually less than 1 mile across
* Usually lasts less than 15 minutes
* Probable in convective weather with havy precip, virgia, moderate or greater turbulence, or 15-30C temperature/dew point spread

## Weather Products
* Convective outlook: national forecast for areas of general and severe thunderstorms
* High level significant prog: 25,000 to 63,000 feet

## FARs
* Equipment: 91.205
  * Including required equipment for IFR:
    * 2-way communication and navigation
    * Gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator
      * Light aircraft under part 91 can have second attitude indicator
    * Slip-skid indicator
    * Sensitive (adjustable) altimeter
    * Clock with seconds
    * Generator/alternator
    * DG
    * DME/RNAV for FL240+
    * VOR or TACAN, or RNAV within Class B
* VOR check
  * VOT: Must be +/- 4 degrees of the expected indication
  * Airborne VOR: Reading +/- 6 degrees
  * VOT best, then designated surface checkpoint, then designated airborne checkpoint
  * Dual VOR check: +/- 4 degrees on a TO indication
  * Custom VOR receiver check: +/- 6 degrees
    * Pick point on victor airway at least 20nm from the VOR
  * In summary:
    * Airborne over checkpoint: 6 degrees
    * All other checks: 4 degrees
  * PADS log entry
    * Place of the check
    * Amount of error
    * Date of the check
    * Signature
* GPS
  * Database must be current
  * Manual must be onboard

## Lost Communication
* FAR 91.185 and AIM 6-4-1
* If VMC
  * Continue flight under VFR and land at a close suitable airport
* Route to fly:
  1. Route assigned by most recent ATC clearance
  2. If being radar vectored, fly direct to the fix or route specified in the vector's clearance
  3. Route that ATC advised may be expected
  4. Route filed in your flight plan
* Altitude to fly: highest of
  1. Assigned altitude
  2. Altitude ATC advised you to expect
  3. Minimum IFR altitude for your route segment
  * You may need to climb higher on future route segments
  * Remain at required altitude until you reach destination
* If ATC told you to expect a certain initial approach fix and procedure, you must fly that fix and procedure
* Leave hold at EFC time given by ATC
  * Do not accept hold without EFC

## Instruments
* Altimeter must be within 75 feet of airport elevation
* Airport elevation defined as highest point on an airport's usable runways
* **Blockages**
  * Static blockage
    * Altimeter will stick and continue to indicate altitude where blockage happened
    * VSI will stay at zero
    * Airspeed indicator
      * Reads correct at altitude where static blocked
      * Higher altitude: reads lower than correct
      * Lower altitude: reads higher than correct
  * Pitot blockage
    * Ram air blocked, drain open: airspeed drops to zero
    * Ram air and drain blocked: airspeed becomes altimeter
* Acceptable DG precession: not more than 3 degrees per 15 minutes

## Clearances
* VFR on Top
  * Pilot must be instrument rated and current
  * IFR flight plan must be filed
  * IFR clearance must be received
  * En route cruise conducted in VMC
  * Cannot enter IMC
  * Must be requested
  * Must follow both VFR and IFR rules
    * VFR rules:
      * Cruise altitude must be VFR
      * Separation is pilot's responsibility
      * Maintain cloud clearances and visibility
    * IFR rules:
      * Maintain centerline of airway or route
      * At or above minimum IFR altitudes
      * Make position reports if not in radar contact
      * Make required IFR reports without request
  * Pilot can pick altitude
  * Advise altitude changes to ATC
  * No separation from ATC unless TRSA or Class B/C airspace
* Cruise clearance
  * Pilot can pick any altitude between minimum for IFR and cruise altitude specified in the clearance
  * Not required to report altitude changes
  * If you descend from an altitude, cannot return to that altitude without ATC clearance
* Block altitude clearance
  * Useful in turbulence
  * Do not advise of altitude changes provided you remain within the block
* Pop-up IFR clearance
* Flight plan and clearance not required in Class G airspace
* Composite Flight Plan
  * Part of the trip is IFR, part is VFR
  * Either can be first
  * Advisable to contact FSS to close VFR flight plan when VFR portion completed
