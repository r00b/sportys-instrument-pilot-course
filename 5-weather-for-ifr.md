# Weather for IFR

* Constant Pressure Charts: entire chart is the same pressure
* Upper level support
  * Conditions aloft favorable for development of storms
* Pressure altitude chart most commonly referred to is 500mb chart
*

* Ability of atmosphere to hold moisture doubles for each 11°C increase in temperature

## Icing
* Large accumulations of ice can reduce drag by 100%+
* Most severe icing occurs where there is both moisture and lifting
  * Lifting creates supercooled water droplets, which are still liquid yet nearly freezing, so they splatter on surfaces and then freeze
* Best propsect for aiframe ice is North and East of a low
* Perpendicular windflow over mountains also creates icing conditions
* Expect icing when flying in visible precipitation and temperature is between -10 and 2°C
* Clear ice
  * Conditions
    * Temps close to freezing point with large bodies of water
    * High aircraft velocities
    * Large droplets
  * Typically found in
    * Supercooled water droplets in cumulus clouds
    * Very unstable air
    * Strong lifting over mountains
* Rime ice
  * Conditions
    * Low temperatures
    * Less liquid water
    * Low velocities
    * Small droplets
  * Typically found in
    * Small supercooled water droplets
    * Stable air
    * Stratus clouds
* Snow does not necessarily/really lead to icing since it is already frozen
* Freezing rain DOES lead to icing
  * Anti-ice and de-ice systems are not certified for flight into freezing rain
  * Icing becomes worse the lower you go
* Rules of thumb
  * Ice not likely if temperature below 15°C
    * But can still form at colder temperatures if lifting is present
  * Average thickness of icing layer is 2000 feet
    * Might be true of stratus conditions, but can be much thicker when lifting present
  * Older clouds may have less ice
    * True of clouds to the west of a low
* PIREPs only useful if fresh and of a similar aircraft flying a similar speed to you
* Roll upset caused by icing
  * Reduce AOA of wing
    * Increase airspeed
    * Extend wing flaps to first setting if able to reduce AOA
  * Set appropriate power
  * Do not retract flaps unless upper surface of airfoil is clear of ice
  * Verify ice protection system is working
* Tailplane stall
  * Causes uncommanded nose down pitch
  * Symptoms
    * Elevator oscillations
    * Nose down trim change
    * Pitch anomalies causing pilot induced oscillations
    * Loss of elevator effectiveness
    * Change of elevator force
  * Counteracted with aft elevator and retraction of flaps
    * Apply power
    * Make nose down pitch changes slowly
* Leave flaps retracted when icing is present; extending flaps may reduce elevator effectiveness
* ILS is best bet for landing with an iced over windshield

## Thunderstorms
* Storm moving east could be roughest east and south of the storm
* GA propeller aircraft are designed with a vertical gust tolerance of 30-50 feet per second
  * Jets, 66 feet per second
  * Thunderstorms have been recorded having up to 75 feet per second
* Thunderstorm gust front can extend over 15 miles out in front of a strong storm
* Requirements
  * Lifting action
  * Instability
  * Moisture
* Two types
  * Iarmass
    * Lifting from convective heating
    * Mountain lift
  * Frontal
    * Squall lines
* Convective SIGMET
  * Lines of thunderstorms at least 60 miles long
  * Area of very strong thunderstorms affecting 3000 square miles covering at least 40% of the area
  * Embedded or severe thunderstorms
* Special issuance criteria:
  * Tornadoes
  * Hail > 3/4" at the surface
  * Wind gusts greater than 50 knots at the surface
  * Indication of rapidly changing conditions
* Embedded thunderstorms usually found in warm or stationary frontal zones
  * Usually not as severe as squall lines storms
  * Might be tornadic activity (especially tropical areas)
  * Develop along frontal slope; cold front underneath the warm front has stable air
* 3 stages
  * Cumulus
  * Mature
  * Dissipating
* Cells will develop between other cells frequently occurs when existing cells are 3 miles or less apart
* Thunderstorms can grow in minutes
* Stay at least 5 miles away, except when severe storms are forecast, then 20 miles

## Datalink Weather
* ADS-B (ground-based) or SiriusXM (satellite-based)
  * NEXRAD radar imagery
  * METARs and TAFs
  * PIREPs
  * TFRs
* ADS-B
  * Poor reception near ground or in mountains
  * Regional radar within 250NM, higher resolution, updated every 5 minutes
  * National radar for entire US, lower resolution, updated every 15 minutes
* SiriusXM
  * No coverage gaps
  * Works on surface and at all altitudes; no line-of-sight restrictions
* Check timestamp of Datalink weather, because it can be delayed
* Age is time since **reception** of data, not **recording** of data
  * Total delay could be 15-20 minutes
* Datalink weather: 4 considerations
  1. Shape
     * Avoid hooks, bows, irregular shapes
  2. Intensity
     * Avoid red/magenta; avoid entire cell, not just magenta/red part
  3. Gradient
     * Steeper the gradient of color, worse the weather
  4. Height
     * Vertical development of the cell
* Cloud tops
  * SiriusXM: observed product
  * ADS-B: forecast product

## Below Minimum Weather
* ILS
  * Typically 1/2 mile visibility, can be as low as 1800 RVR
  * DA typically 200 feet AGL but can be higher
* VOR
  * Lowest possible is 250 AGL
* NDB
  * Lowest possible is 350 AGL
* Go look up different types of fog out of the PPL practice test book
* On a VOR approach, there is only 250 feet of obstruction clearance along and on either side of the approach course

## Turbulence
* Significant turbulence along troughs aloft and occluded fronts
* Rotor below ridge level of mountains
* Avoid flying airways where MEA is within 4-6000 feet of your airplane's service ceiling when it is moderately windy
* Lateral wind shifts
  * 40 kt wind change in 150 miles: potentially severe turbulence
* Vertical wind shifts
  * 10 knot wind change per 1000 feet: potentially severe turbulence
* Pilot induced turbulence via contorl surfaces starts at aft of wing and moves forward
* Wind shear induced turbulence starts at leading edge of wing and moves backward

## Middle Altitude Weather
* Jet stream core affects winds in high teens
  * Turbulence pronounced when velocities exceed 100 kts
* Freezing level in fronts is often between 15 and 20,000 feet with lots of moisture
* Clear air turbulence
  * Usually light or moderate chop
  * Moderate chop in a jetliner will probably be even worse for light aircraft
* When flying high, must also consider 500mb chart in coordination with surface analysis chart
  * If not available, consult winds aloft at FL180
  * East-west flow generally indicates stability
* Cutoff flow / closed low aloft
  * Counterclockwise circulation in atmostphere
  * Complete circular flow around a low
  * Shown on 500mb
  * Lots of turbulence
  * Difficult to forecast formation or dissipation of closed low aloft; thus, difficult to forecast surface conditions/weather

## Nighttime Weather
* Bad weather in evening usually gets worse over night before it gets better
